This is an Iron Yard assignment to practice iteration (looping) and conditionals.

The objective is to create a loop and check for specific values using conditional statements as well as how to add data to objects.

There are two programs in this repository. One is Word Frequency and the other is FizzBuzz.
Word Frequency creates a function called wordFrequency which receives a string and returns the frequency of each word in it as an object. Fizzbuzz creates a function called fizzBuzz that will count from 1 to a numeric limit passed in as an argument and return an array of the numbers.

This assignment is by Nadia Mughal and David Steed.
